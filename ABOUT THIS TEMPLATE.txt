Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that manages and optimizes traffic for your web applications. Hereâ€™s a concise overview of its configuration:

1. Creating Application Gateway
Basic Settings: Choose subscription, resource group, region, and name.
Frontend Configuration: Choose between Public or Private IP, and set the listener (HTTP or HTTPS).
Backend Pool: Define backend servers (VMs, VMSS, IPs).
Routing: Set up URL path-based or host-based routing.
Health Probes: Monitor backend health and configure timeout/intervals.
2. Key Settings
Listeners: Define HTTP/HTTPS listeners to handle incoming traffic.
Routing Rules: Direct traffic based on URL paths or hostnames.
Backend HTTP Settings: Configure port, protocol, and session affinity.
Web Application Firewall (WAF): Enable WAF for security protection (SQL Injection, XSS).
3. Advanced Features
SSL Termination: Offload SSL decryption at the gateway.
Auto-scaling: Automatically scale based on traffic (available in Standard_v2/WAF_v2).
Logs: Enable diagnostic and access logs for monitoring.
4. Considerations
Scalability: Ensure autoscaling and proper backend scaling.
Cost: Costs depend on tier, instances, and throughput units.
5. Use Cases
Load balancing, SSL offloading, URL-based routing, microservices, and web application protection (WAF).
This concise configuration of Azure Application Gateway ensures optimized traffic management, security, and scalability for your web apps.
